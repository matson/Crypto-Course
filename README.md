# Crypto-Course
Python code regarding Cryptography.
All of this code is my work regarding the problems I am assigned in my Cryptography class.
They may not be 100% correct, but they are my best attempts in solving them.  Overall, the course has 
allowed me to dive into Python every single day and makes me practice.  Needless to say, it is easy to use
Python 3 versus C++ or C to solve these problems.
